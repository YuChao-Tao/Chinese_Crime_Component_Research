# Chinese_Crime_Component_Research 
The Chinese crime component data is come from the bulletin of the Supreme People's Court, the page link is http://gongbao.court.gov.cn/ArticleList.html?serial_no=sftj
I try to find the phenomenon and some changes hide in the Chinese crime data, because of the gov's publicity, I only get the data from 2002 to 2018.
I have a further thought that get US crime data into this program, whether I can compare the difference between China and America about their crime structure.
